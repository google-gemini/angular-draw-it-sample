# Angular Web Audio melodies sample

Developer sample written in Angular demonstrating Gemini multimodal (image and audio) input and understanding. The user enters a prompt and the app generates images via VertexAI’s image generation which the user can after that preview in a three-dimensional gallery. The user has an input where they can ask a question about the images. Using Web Audio’s Speech Synthesis API we read Gemini’s answer for the images.
